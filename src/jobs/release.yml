  The release job represents the steps for the 'Release & Deliver' phase of the DevSecOps software lifecycle.
  Release and delivery does not mean pushed into production nessecarily. Rather the artifact is tagged with a 
  version within the source code configuration management tool and deployed into an artifact repository.
  For more information check out DoD Cyber Exchange's DoDEnterpriseDevSecOpsFundamentals.pdf.

  This job specifically supports GitHub as the VCS and DockerHub as the artifact repository. There are two types
  of releases supported by the release job; pre-release, stable release (release).

  For the pre-release flow, the GitHub release will be marked as pre-release. The only validation is that the
  version being used is a unique tag. After a successful GitHub release, the docker image will be tagged and pushed.
  The docker image is not built in the release job. With this in mind, ensure that the release job requires a
  previous build job.

  For the stable release flow, the GitHub release will be updated as a stable release. After successfully updating the GitHub release,
  the docker image will be promoted from the version to latest.

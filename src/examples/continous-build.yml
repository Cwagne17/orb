  The Continuous Build feedback loop iterates between the Develop and Build phases of the
  DevSecOps lifecycle. If build does not complete successfully, then the commit must be sent back
  to the submitting engineer to fix; without a successful build, further steps are both illogical
  and impossible to complete, thus the importance of this feedback loop.
